# CCD_Image_Processing
Code to process image obtained from CCDs

This code aims to process the image obatined from telescopes observing the nightsky, made esp for the CCD based obervatories.
The code relies on two pieces of pre-observation data - 1. Dark Bias Observation 2. Flat Observation

#Dependencies
1. Numpy - For manipulation of data matrices
2. Astropy - Specifically the astropy.io.fits flies for accessing FITS files and to output the results as FITS files
